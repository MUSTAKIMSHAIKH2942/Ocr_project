This project provides a basic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application using Python libraries.
# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with OpenCV and EasyOCR

This repository contains a Python script for performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images using OpenCV and EasyOCR libraries.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install easyocr


Select or provide an image:

The script will ask you to enter the path to an image file containing text.
Alternatively, you can leave the input blank to use a default image included in the project (if provided).
View the results:

The script will perform OCR on the image and display the extracted text on the console.
